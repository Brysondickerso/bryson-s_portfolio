## Projects

### 1. **Shift Data Model**
   - **Description**: 
     The **Shift Data Model** is an interactive dashboard showcasing shift data across the United States for the Nursegrid app. Users can select filters to view detailed information on all users who had shifts. This model provides valuable insights into nurse shift activity by allowing users to filter and explore data based on multiple dimensions, including date, state, city, hospital, and department.
   - **Tools Used**: Excel, SQL.
     
   - **Skills Demonstrated**:
     - Writing and optimizing SQL queries to clean, transform, and retrieve large datasets.
     - Designing an interactive, filterable dashboard in Snowflake for a user-friendly experience.
     - Data storytelling by presenting key metrics and trends.
       
   - **Key Features**:
     - **Filtering**: Select a filter to dynamically display user-specific shift data.
     - **Exportable Reports**: Designed for easy sharing and integration into reporting workflows.
       
   - **Key Insights**:
     - Identified states and cities with the highest concentration of shifts and staffing needs.
     - Revealed trends in user participation, highlighting opportunities for better workforce management.

## 3. **User Certification & Licensing Dashboard**

**Description**:  
The **User Certification & Licensing Dashboard** provides insights into the certifications and positions of users who are logged into the Nursegrid app. The data for this project was sourced from internal databases and processed using SQL and Snowflake to ensure high performance with large datasets. 

-**Tools Used**: SQL, Excel, Snowflake, Python
 
-**Skills Demonstrated**:  
   - **SQL Query Writing**: Wrote complex SQL queries to aggregate, join, and filter user data from multiple tables within Snowflake, ensuring that all relevant information about       certifications, positions, and licenses was available for analysis.  
   - **Data Transformation in Snowflake**: Leveraged Snowflakeâ€™s cloud data platform to clean, transform, and aggregate large datasets efficiently, enabling faster querying and          data exploration.
     
-**Key Features**:  
   - **Certification Tracking**: Track which certifications are held by users across various positions.  
   - **Position-Based Insights**: Analyze how many users in each position hold the necessary certifications and licenses.  
   - **Comprehensive Reporting**: Exportable reports to help stakeholders track certification statuses and workforce compliance across regions.
